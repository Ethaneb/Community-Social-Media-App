# Introduction
This is a social media website I wrote for my advanced web development final. 
- I used ReactJS for the front end.
- It uses Firebase for user authentication, database management and storage.

# Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:


Note: **Make sure you have node.js installed**


1. **Navigate to the client directory:**
    ```sh
    cd client
    ```

2. **Install the project dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Install Firebase:**
    ```sh
    npm install firebase
    ```

4. **Install React Router DOM:**
    ```sh
    npm install react-router-dom
    ```

5. **Start the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.
